            <p> <span>My Experience with Programming</span><br>
        I graduated from an academic institute in Information Technology in 2022, where I finished first in my class. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in programming, especially in C++. I became very skilled in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and learned how to write clean, efficient, and structured code.

Through my experience, I worked on several projects that helped me understand how programming connects theory with real-life applications. I also gained good problem-solving skills and learned how to think logically to create effective solutions.

Programming has always been one of my favorite parts of ICT, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to improve my skills and learn more languages in the future.
