    <p><span>Why I Chose ICT</span><br>
        Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in computers and technology. I loved playing games, using different programs, and learning how everything works inside a computer. Later, this interest grew into a real passion. I started to enjoy building computers, changing parts, and learning how programming makes things come to life.

What I like about ICT is that it mixes creativity with problem-solving. It’s a place where I can use my ideas to create something new, fix problems, and understand how systems work together. Every time I learn something new, I feel more motivated to go deeper into this field.

For me, ICT is more than just a study choice. It’s something that truly fits who I am. It connects my love for gaming, computers, and technology, and gives me a future where I can keep learning, building, and creating.</p></div>
