                From the feedback I received, I learned that my blog project needed to include five connected pages, each explaining a specific topic. This helped me understand the importance of organizing information clearly across multiple pages.

The feedback was also very positive. I was told that my color choices were well balanced, and that my code was clean, understandable, and easy to navigate. Iâ€™m glad that my design and structure made the website user-friendly.

One important point I learned was about project organization. I needed to arrange my files into separate folders to make the project more professional and easier to manage. After this feedback, I worked on improving my folder structure and overall organization.

This feedback helped me see what I did well and what I can still improve for future projects.</p>
