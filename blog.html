        <h1>My Journey with Programming and Gaming</h1>
        <p class = "date-p">Published on September 11.</p>
        <p>
I have a background in Information Technology, where I graduated with a solid foundation in computer science and problem-solving. Over the years, I have gained experience in programming and discovered how much I enjoy creating solutions with code.

Programming is not just a skill for me; it is a passion. I see myself building projects, learning new technologies, and growing into a successful developer. At the same time, gaming has always been a part of my life. It inspires me to think creatively and motivates me to improve myself.

My dream is to combine both worlds: to become a professional programmer and, at the same time, a skilled gamer. I believe this combination allows me to stay motivated, innovative, and determined to achieve my goals.
